Advanced Sholl Analysis
http://imagejdocu.tudor.lu/doku.php?id=plugin:analysis:asa:start

A plugin for ImageJ, the standard in scientific image processing. Sholl analysis
is a century old technique used by neuroanatomists to describe neuronal arbors.

Major advantages of this plugin over other implementations are:
 - It does not require previous tracing of the arbor
 - Retrieves quantitative descriptors from the Sholl profile, allowing
   statistical comparisons between arbors
 - Performs "Continuous Sholl" in 2D/3D
