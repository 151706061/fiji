To do:
- Add an option for All methods?
- Extend to 3D (How does Simple Neurite Tracer do it)?
- Only works with point selection in IJ2 and is extremely slow.
- Recheck if methods to retrieve ROIs are correct.

Version 2.3a
    - Fixed issue introduced in 2.3min which -1 tagged pixels were being counted
    - Fixed rounding in mask drawing
    - Center ROI is dislayed on mask
	- Plot is named after analyzed image
	- Improve order of Table columns
	- showStatus more informative

Version 2.3
	- Results printed to a dedicated table
	- Sholl decay is always calculated when fitting curve
	- Fixed exception in cv calculation
	- Impose valid parameters, rather than keep prompting the user (buggy, e.g.,
	  when recording macros)
    - Progress bar is more informative
    - Major code cleaning
    - Minor fixes

Version 2.2
	- Fixed offset of plot label
	- Checks for reasonable Radius span value
    - Code cleaning: more intuitive variable names
	- Fix crashed caused by mis-evaluation in DoSpikeSupression
