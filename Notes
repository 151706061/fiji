Advanced Sholl Analysis
Version 3 (final)
    - Allows (thresholded) grayscale images as input
    - Fixed rounding errors with digitization of spheres
    - Better handling of anisotropic voxels
    - 3D Sholl is now ~25% faster
    - Major code clean up, which solved several issues
    - Precision in Sholl table is set by Analyze>Set Measurements...
	- Sholl mask is coded with Matlab's "jet" color map

Version 3d
    - Analysis is now restricted to the volume of the largest Sholl shell, rather than
      parsing all the voxels in the image

Version 3c
    - 3D Sholl is significantly faster, and usable for the first time, but remains
      extremely slow
    - Substituted "Radius span" with "Samples per radius" to avoid confusions (user
      request), imposing a draconian maximum to encourage "Continuos Sholl"
    - Mask is a Maximum Intensity Projection of the analyzed stack

Version 3a-b
    - Performs 3D Sholl (without spike suppression), if input image is a stack
    - Analyzes polarized arbors by restricting the analysis to hemicircles or hemispheres.
      This requires the user to define the center of analysis with an orthogonal chord,
      using the Straight Line Tool and holding Shift

Version 2.5
    - Fixed duplicated points in Bresenham's algorithm
    - Foreground is now any value greater than 0
    - Option to save Sholl profiles
    - Long analyses can be aborted by holding Esc

Version 2.4
    - Fixed a 2.3 regression in which -1 tagged pixels were being counted
    - Fixed rounding in mask drawing
    - Center ROI is dislayed on mask
    - Plot is named after analyzed image
    - Improved Sholl Table

Version 2.3
    - Results printed to a dedicated table
    - Sholl decay is always calculated when performing curve fitting
    - Fixed exception in cv calculation
    - Impose valid parameters, rather than keep prompting the user (which is
      buggy, e.g., when recording macros)
    - Major code cleaning

Version 2.1-2
    - Fixed several bugs and regressions introduced in version 2.0
    - Checks for reasonable Radius span values

Version 2.0
     - Curve Fitting, modernization of Tom's code

Version 1.0
     - Initial version by Tom Maddock
