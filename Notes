To fix:	
	- 3D extremely slow!!
	- private static Line chord;
	- System.gc
	
Version 3a
    - 3D Sholl: Performs connectivity checks (without spike suppression)
    - z-position of center is recorded in table
    - Maximal Area of Analysis is now the square containing last circle, rather
      than the entire image;
    
Version 3
    - 3D Sholl: Checks connectivity within slice
    - SInce connectivity is not done in z, the min set size mus be at least the z-spacing

Version 3
    - Performs 3D Sholl

Version 2.5
    - Fixed duplicated points in Bresenham's algorithm
    - Foreground is any value greater than 0
    - Option to save Sholl profiles
    - Can be aborted by holding Esc

Version 2.4
    - Analysis can be restricted to an area, using initial line as a chord
    - Fixed issue introduced in 2.3min which -1 tagged pixels were being counted
    - Fixed rounding in mask drawing
    - Center ROI is dislayed on mask
	- Plot is named after analyzed image
	- Improved order of Table columns
	- showStatus more informative

Version 2.3
	- Results printed to a dedicated table
	- Sholl decay is always calculated when fitting curve
	- Fixed exception in cv calculation
	- Impose valid parameters, rather than keep prompting the user (buggy, e.g.,
	  when recording macros)
    - Progress bar is more informative
    - Major code cleaning
    - Minor fixes

Version 2.2
	- Fixed offset of plot label
	- Checks for reasonable Radius span value
    - Code cleaning: more intuitive variable names
	- Fix crashed caused by mis-evaluation in DoSpikeSupression
