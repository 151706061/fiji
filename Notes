Advanced Sholl Analysis
Version 3d
    - Small performance improvement: Analysis is now restricted to the volume of
      the largest shell, rather than parsing all the voxels in the image

Version 3c
    - 3D Sholl is significantly faster, and usable for the first time, but
      remains extremely slow
    - Substituted "Radius span" with "Samples per radius" to avoid confusions,
      imposing a draconian maximum to encourage continuos analyses
    - Since it only serves illustration purposes, mask is now a MIP of the
      analyzed stack

Version 3b
    - 3D Sholl: Connectivity checks between slices (without spike suppression),
    - z-position of center is recorded in table

Version 3a
    - 3D Sholl: Connectivity checks within slice

Version 3
    - Performs 3D Sholl, if input image is a stack
    - It can analyze polarized arbors by restricting the analysis to hemicircles
      or hemispheres. This requires the user to define the center of Analysis
      with an orthogonal chord

Version 2.5
    - Fixed duplicated points in Bresenham's algorithm
    - Foreground is now any value greater than 0
    - Option to save Sholl profiles
    - Long analysis can be aborted by holding Esc

Version 2.4
    - Analysis can be restricted to an area, using initial line as a chord
    - Fixed issue introduced in 2.3min which -1 tagged pixels were being counted
    - Fixed rounding in mask drawing
    - Center ROI is dislayed on mask
    - Plot is named after analyzed image
    - Improved Sholl Table

Version 2.3
    - Results printed to a dedicated table
    - Sholl decay is always calculated when fitting curve
    - Fixed exception in cv calculation
    - Impose valid parameters, rather than keep prompting the user (which is
      buggy, e.g., when recording macros)
    - Progress bar is more informative
    - Major code cleaning

Version 2.2
    - Fixed offset of plot label
    - Checks for reasonable Radius span value
    - Code cleaning: more intuitive variable names
    - Fix crashed caused by mis-evaluation in DoSpikeSupression

Version 1.1-2.1
     - Curve Fitting, modernization of Tom's code
