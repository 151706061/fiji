Could we use the packaged commons-math?
  http://packages.debian.org/squeeze/libcommons-math-java
  http://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/libcommons-math-java

jna.jar is packaged in libjna-java - should use that

Need all the LICENSES and AUTHORS files

Allow a per-user plugins directory as well as the system-wide one.

bio-formats includes lots of jars in the source archive - there's a
   dependency tangle to be sorted out there
