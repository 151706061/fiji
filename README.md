It works, but still things to do. 

Things to do:

+ Console output is not really good. Examine IMain class so that the output becomes simplified. 
+ VM argument to set the scala mode should be within the code. Currently, externally givien. 
+ import of ImageJ classes should be done faster using IMain class.
